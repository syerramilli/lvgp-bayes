# Latent variable Gaussian process models with fully Bayesian inference.

LVGP-Bayes is a Python library for estimating Latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) models through fully Bayesian inference. This respository contains code to run the experiments in the paper [Fully Bayesian inference for latent variable Gaussian process models](https://doi.org/10.1137/22M1525600). 

For reproducing the experiments, refer to the each subdirectory in the `experiments/` folder.

**Note:** The code is under an Academic and Non-Commerical Research use license.
